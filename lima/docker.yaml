# Example to use Docker instead of containerd & nerdctl
# $ limactl start ./docker.yaml
# $ limactl shell docker docker run -it -v $HOME:$HOME --rm alpine

# To run `docker` on the host (assumes docker-cli is installed):
# $ export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/docker.sock
# $ docker ...

# This example requires Lima v0.8.0 or later
images:
# Try to use release-yyyyMMdd image if available. Note that release-yyyyMMdd will be removed after several months.
